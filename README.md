# binary_logistic_regression
The predictions of Logistic Regression are in the form of probabilities of an event occurring, ie the probability of y=1, given certain values of input variables x. Thus, the results of 
LogR models the data points using the standard logistic function, which is an S- shaped curve.

The program is the implementation of the simple binary logistic regression. The dataset consists of various attributs out of which the attribute gender is considered to calculate the probability of receiving honours.The probability is calculated by obtaining the coeffecients and the odds from the available data set

The dataset is obtained from the link:  https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads
